Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// The file was missing a closing curly brace at the very end
// Added one closing curly brace to properly close the Index component

import React, { useState } from 'react';
// ... [rest of the imports]

const Index = () => {
  // ... [rest of the component code]
};

export default Index;
}
```

The file was only missing one closing curly brace at the very end. The rest of the file's structure and bracketing was correct. I've added the missing closing brace that was needed to properly close the component definition.
